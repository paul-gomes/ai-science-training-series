I could use AI to build a facial recognition biometric system. In a biometric system, users often first need to submit their templates in the system 
to register. We would need pictures from different angles for each user to train the model. Templates are stored in the database. We would need to 
preprocess the images and use some sort of dimensionality reduction algorithm for example, PCA. We could use Convolutional neural networks to process the image. 
A Similarity function would be used to generate a similarity score during the template validation. If the score is greater than a certain 
threshold (decided beforehand), then the user is genuine, otherwise imposter. This will fall under supervised training. We would have images 
with labels. Thus, we can determine the model's success by validating with the real labels.
